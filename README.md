# Delivery-Router
The delivery router aims to ensure better delivery to customers based on data structure: linked list, queue, stack, dictionary and list.  The functions receive requested parameters, which contain all address information, including geographic coordinates, whose script calculates the distance in kilometers to verify the best sequence of deliveries.
